## Provide a list of kernels for which the SDE can build its modules.
##
## Each attribute set in the list provides two items.  The first is
## the name of the kernel release exactly as it is reported by "uname
## -r" on a system that runs this kernel.  The second is a derivation
## that reproduces what is expected to be the contents of the
## directory /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build after installing all
## native packages required for module compilation.  This derivation
## is used by ../generic.nix to perform the actual build of the
## modules.
##
## The creation of /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build clearly depends
## heavily on the native package manager of the system.  The purpose
## of the logic below is to remove the dependence on those package
## managers to create a distribution-agnostic version of the kernel
## build directory.
