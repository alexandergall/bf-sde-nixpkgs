## Provide a set of kernels for which the SDE can build its modules.
##
## The name of each set identifies the kernel and is used as input to
## the buildModules passthru function of the bf-sde package to perform
## the actual build of the kernel modules.
##
## Each set has the following attributes
##
##   release
##     the name of the kernel release exactly as it is reported by
##     "uname -r" on a system which runs that kernel.
##
##   buildTree
##     A derivation which provides a complete kernel build tree
##     in which the kernel modules can be compiled. This is what
##     is usually found in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build on
##     a system on which the kernel development packages have
##     been installed by the native package manager of the system.
##
##   patches
##     An optional attribute set of patches to be applied to the
##     bf-drivers source before building the kernel modules.  The
##     names in this set must be SDE versions in the form
##     <major>.<minor>.<patch> and the values must be lists of
##     patches.
##
##   buildModulesOverrides
##     An optional attribute set of overrides for the derivation
##     returned by ./build-modules.nix.
