# Release Notes for v7

## Restructuring of the full and runtime SDE environments

The scripts that used to be provided by the pkgs.tools sub-packages
have been integrated into the build procedure of the environments.
The scripts are now called from wrappers that set the SDE and
SDE_INSTALL environment variables automatically to simplify their
usage.  This affects

   * `run_switchd.sh`
   * `run_tofino_model.sh`
   * `run_p4_tests.sh`
   * `p4_build.sh`

The pkgs.tools sub-package has been removed.

## Changed handling of sudo

Various scripts are using sudo to gain root privileges. The `setuid`
mechanism is not supported by `nixpkgs` at all (unless it is part of a
full NixOS system).  In previous versions, a hack was used to work
around this deficiency.  The new approach is to replace `sudo`
everywhere with it absolute path `/usr/bin/sudo` to make the
dependency on the host package explicit while still keeping all other
dependencies confined to `/nix/store`.
