# Release Notes for v12

This release implements the following features

   * Support of Debian 11.0 kernel (5.10.0-8-amd64)
   * The name of the interface used for management access is now
     platform-independent (`mgmt0`). This is done by a
     platform-specific `udev` rule.
   * Improved error handling by the `release-manager`
