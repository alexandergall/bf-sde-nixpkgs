# Release Notes for v15

This release implements the following features

   * Experimental support for multiple Tofino targets (Tofino 1 and
     2). The `buildP4Program` function takes an additional argument
     `target` to select the target to compile for.

   * Add support for SDEs 9.7.1, 9.7.2 and 9.8.0.
   
   * Pin the `linux-image-amd64` package when creating an ONIE
     installer with the `mkOnieInstaller` support function to avoid
     accidental upgrades of the kernel
