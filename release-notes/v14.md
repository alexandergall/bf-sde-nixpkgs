# Release Notes for v14

This release implements the following features

   * Improve usability of the development shell

     The "make env" procedure is replaced by packages that contain
     commands to start the shell. These commands can be installed in a
     user's environment and work without the existence of a clone of
     the Git repository. The packages are built by a new Make target
     `install`.

	 A standalone installer for a command can be created by `make
     standalone`.  It can be copied to any host with Nix installed to
     instantiate the development environment without requiring network
     access.

   * Add support for the APS BSP for the `stordis_bf2556x_1t` platform
     for SDE 9.7.0
