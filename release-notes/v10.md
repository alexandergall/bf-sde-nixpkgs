# Release Notes for v10

## SDE 9.6.0

Support for version 9.6.0 was added in release v9 using the
traditional GNU autotools-based build system. That build system has
been replaced by one based on CMake starting with 9.5.0. The
autotools-based system is still present in 9.6.0 but no longer
supported by Intel. The main feature of v10 is the switch to the CMake
build system for 9.6.0.  Version v9 is deprecated for use with 9.6.0.

## Release Support Functions

A new option `--auto-switch` was added to the `--install-release`,
`--install-git` and `--update-release` options of `release-manager`.
It instructs the release manager to immediately switch to the new
release if the installation was successful.

The install commands no longer issue an error if a release is already
installed to make the command idempotent to ease integration with
Ansible.
