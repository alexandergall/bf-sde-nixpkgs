# Release Notes for v9

## Release Support Functions

The v9 release adds a library of functions that facilitate the
creation of releases and installers for appliances that run a
SDE-based application.  The code is located in `bf-sde/support` and
currently provides the functions

   * `mkRelease`
   * `mkReleaseClosure`
   * `mkOnieInstaller`
   * `mkStandaloneInstaller`
   * `mkReleaseManager`

These functions can be accessed through the `support` attribute of the
SDE package. See the README file in `bf-sde/support` for a detailed
description.
