# Release Notes for v11

## SDE 9.6.0

The support for 9.6.0 introduced in v10 is not suitable for binary
deployments using a restricted binary cache (i.e. one that does not
contain any material protected by an NDA with Intel).  The reason is
that the evaluation of the Nix expression for the SDE requires access
to the SDE source code to check for the presence of a CMake file to
determine the type of build system. This will always lead to a failure
even if the packages are available from the binary cache.

This release mitigates the problem by basing the determination of the
build system required by a specific SDE on the SDE version alone.

Applications that use 9.6.0 and need to support restricted binary
deployments must use v11 or later releases.
